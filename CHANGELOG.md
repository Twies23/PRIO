# PRIO Changelog

## 0.1.25
- Fixed the Profiles page buttons rendering as solid blocks with no visible text.
- **Arms:** removed the redundant Warbreaker line — the Colossus Smash button smart-swaps to Warbreaker when talented.
- **Marksmanship:** Black Arrow moved to a low-priority Precise Shots spender, matching the guide.

## 0.1.24
- **Profiles** (Options → Profiles): save your settings and priority lists as named profiles, then apply or delete them. The recommended preset lives here too.
- When a future release changes the default priorities, PRIO now prompts you on login (only if you have customized lists) to reset to the new defaults.

## 0.1.23
- Elemental: Voltaic Blaze in Cleave/AoE now only appears when the **Voltaic Blaze talent is selected**. It was showing even without it because Voltaic Blaze shares an override with Flame Shock (so "is known" read true). Reset Cleave/AoE to default to pick this up.

## 0.1.22
- Fixed conditions showing "?" — old custom lists made before a fix could collapse a nested condition into an empty clause. Condition copy is now recursive, and the pandemic clause reads "in pandemic".
- Priority dots (and the text export) now show a grey **not talented** state for abilities you don't have, instead of a misleading green.
- Elemental tuning: ST drops the separate Voltaic Blaze line (Flame Shock smart-swaps to it); AoE drops Elemental Blast (unused there) and a redundant Chain Lightning; Cleave drops a redundant Chain Lightning. Reset your Elemental lists to default to pick these up.

## 0.1.21
- **Export a priority list as text** — the Priorities page has an Export button (or /prio export). It opens a selectable box you can copy (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C) with each ability, its condition, and live pass/fail — handy for sharing or annotating.
- Fixed: switching **talent loadouts** is now detected automatically out of combat (previously the talent-based logic only updated when you changed an individual talent).

## 0.1.20
- The condition editor now lists each spec's full set of relevant buffs/debuffs, so you can build lists referencing anything the spec uses even when you aren't talented into it.
- **Arms:** Rend now refreshes in its pandemic window (like Elemental Flame Shock), with a setup checklist and optional Rend pandemic alert.
- **Marksmanship & Beast Mastery:** added first-time setup checklists and their relevant-buff lists.

## 0.1.19
- Fixed the condition editor showing a blank ("—") spell for build-specific buffs (like Purging Flames or Lava Surge) when you aren't talented into them. The dropdown now always lists every aura referenced by the spec's conditions, across all specs.

## 0.1.18
- Fixed the Elemental Flame Shock / Voltaic Blaze default conditions (they used a nested condition group that showed blank in the editor and evaluated incorrectly). They now correctly refresh when Flame Shock is missing or in its pandemic window. If you customized your Elemental list, use "Reset to default".

## 0.1.17
- Elemental: Voltaic Blaze now refreshes Flame Shock in its pandemic window in **single target** (matching Flame Shock), but is cast **on cooldown** in Cleave/AoE, matching the guide. If you've customized your Elemental list, use "Reset to default" to pick this up.

## 0.1.16
- The priority list now shows a **live pass/fail dot** next to each ability, so you can see at a glance whether its condition is currently met (green = passing, red = failing, amber = unreadable).
- Elemental: Flame Shock now always refreshes if it drops off, and only does the early pandemic-window refresh when you're not mid Master-of-the-Elements spend.

## 0.1.15
- Fixed the **close (×) button** on PRIO windows not responding (it was being covered by window content), and gave it a cleaner look that highlights red on hover.

## 0.1.14
- The UI accent is now **class-colored** by default (toggle "Class-colored accent" in Behavior to go back to PRIO green).
- The Setup checklist now has **Apply recommended settings** (a tuned layout preset) and **Customize** (opens the options) buttons.

## 0.1.13
- Added a per-spec **first-time Setup checklist** that auto-opens once per spec: it shows what to configure (tracked auras, enemy nameplates, optional pandemic alerts) with a live status that turns green as you set each one up. Reopen anytime with /prio setup.

## 0.1.12
- Added a one-time tip on login explaining how to enable pandemic-window tracking in the Cooldown Manager (only for specs that use it). Dismiss with "Got it", or re-open anytime with /prio pandemic.

## 0.1.11
- **Flame Shock now refreshes in its pandemic window** (the last ~30%, refresh without clipping) using Blizzard's own pandemic state. New "In pandemic (refreshable)" condition is available in the priority editor for any tracked DoT. Needs the spell's "Pandemic Time" alert enabled in the Cooldown Manager; without it, Flame Shock still refreshes when it drops off.

## 0.1.10
- Re-added a Flame Shock pandemic readout to the Debug window using Blizzard's own pandemic state (secret-safe). Requires enabling the "Pandemic Time" alert for Flame Shock in the Cooldown Manager.

## 0.1.9
- Fixed Lava Surge tracking (was pointing at the passive spell 77756 instead of the buff aura 77762) — the instant-Lava-Burst lines, proc flash, and Lava Burst charge reset now read it correctly.

## 0.1.8
- Removed the experimental Flame Shock pandemic rows from the Debug window — testing confirmed aura durations are hidden in combat, so a true pandemic/refresh window isn't readable. Flame Shock refresh timing continues to use PRIO's own prediction.

## 0.1.7
- **Fixed a flood of Lua errors** when the Debug window was open — the pandemic/aura probes were touching secret values. They're now fully guarded, and the Debug panel can't error out even if a probe fails.

## 0.1.6
- Added `/prio power` — a diagnostic that shows which of your class resources read cleanly in combat, used to validate spec support.

## 0.1.5
- Added the groundwork for **pandemic / refresh windows** — PRIO can now read Blizzard's Cooldown Manager pandemic state for DoTs like Flame Shock.
- Debug window shows live pandemic and aura-timing info to validate what's readable in combat.

## 0.1.4
- **New spec: Enhancement Shaman** (Stormbringer + Totemic).
- Debug window now shows live Maelstrom Weapon / aura details for tuning.

## 0.1.3
- Packaging setup for CurseForge.

## 0.1.2
- **Fixed target counting** so Cleave/AoE actually kicks in: PRIO now enables enemy nameplates for you (it needs them to see the pack). New option to turn that off.
- Debug window shows nameplate status.

## 0.1.1
- **Elemental:** now correctly spends Master of the Elements instead of double-casting Lava Burst.
- **Primary advances while casting** — as you hard-cast, the shown ability moves to your next button.
- **Fixed mode getting stuck in Single Target** in real content.
- **Arms:** Rend no longer locks the priority; Mortal Strike leads single target.
- Debug window is now per-spec.

## 0.1.0
- First release.
- Specs: **Elemental Shaman**, **Marksmanship Hunter**, **Beast Mastery Hunter**, **Arms Warrior**.
- Shows your current ability plus the upcoming queue, with cast/GCD swipes and proc flashes.
- Standalone options UI with a priority editor, a spec-aware Debug window, and a minimap button.
- Priority lists adapt to your talents and hero tree automatically.
